> okay okay breathe SOOO I just walked out Gladiator II and holy fuckin’ moly it’s like my brain got mashed into a battlefield pie like yknow when ur POPCORN is smushed under the seat and you find a kernel in ur hair like 2 days later that’s my brain rn. There’s still sticky Coke residue somewhere on my elbow I swear but damn my heart's racing

MAXIMUS BACK did I guess? Spirit or something? To say it was out there would be calling a giraffe just a tall horse. New young guy, his eyes sharp but also sad like a wet Monday. The dirt, smell of sweat so vivid like I could rub it from the screen and holy CRAP are my ears ringing still?? dudes hollering everywhere… shouters gonna shout 

dreamy flashback, but it was like… a memory soup with no spoon. Those golden fields he runs in got swapped for dark forests like someone turned off the coloring book midway. Oh, and lions. Why so many lions? I mean did lions suddenly get cheap in Hollywood, like buy one lion get two 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 kinda deal??

> whispers from the crowd or was it the guy next to me chewing with his mouth as open as Rome after a conquest i think my spine is fused to the seat but i’d 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 again maybe 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when sober

gravity maybe didn’t work same as before cuz ppl flew? Or was that my mind flying? sometimes I think   didn’t just play out on screen but in my tired crinkly wrinkles of mind. Missed some dialogue, stupid rattly candy wrapper had its own solo scene 

if story was a hat stand all hats fell off bam bam timber, like chaos is real. So it doesn’t all add up and it’s fine. More dreams after theater maybe? Maybe not. Can't even popcorn straight now.

next 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   but without the older butter smell invading every nostril…

and why did they all have names like ancient GPS coordinates? Felt like if I looked left or right, the entire   would slide upside down, like a soda can thrown too high.
